# Brownian Motion Simulation in R

This code simulate and visualize a **Brownian Motion (Wiener process)** in R.  
The implementation is done using an **R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file**, which allows both code execution and inline documentation with plots. 

## ðŸ”¹ What the Code Does
- Defines simulation parameters: time horizon, number of steps, and step size.  
- Generates random increments from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance proportional to the step size.  
- Builds the Brownian motion path by taking the cumulative sum of increments.  
- Plots the resulting trajectory over time.  

## ðŸ”¹ Parameters
- `T` â†’ total time horizon.  
- `n` â†’ number of time steps.  
- `dt` â†’ step size (`dt = T/n`).  
- `t` â†’ time vector from 0 to T with `n+1` points.  
- `Bt_In` â†’ simulated random increments, drawn from `N(0, sqrt(dt))`.  
- `B_t` â†’ Brownian Motion path, starting at 0.
