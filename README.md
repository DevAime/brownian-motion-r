# Brownian Motion Simulation in R

This repository contains R code for simulating and visualizing **Brownian Motion** (also known as a Wiener process).  
Brownian Motion is a fundamental concept in probability theory and stochastic processes, widely used in **finance, physics, and mathematics**.

## Features
- Generates Brownian motion increments using normally distributed random variables.
- Constructs a Brownian motion path using cumulative sums.
- Plots the simulated path with time on the x-axis and process values on the y-axis.
